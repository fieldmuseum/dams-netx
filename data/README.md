# Data examples


## config
This folder includes example setup-files for **dams-netx** scripts, **NetX I/O** and **NetX DSS**.
- `SecDepartment_hierarchy.csv` - should be referenced by prep-scripts and variables in this repo's `.env` 
  - This example shows a mapping between flat values from EMu into hierarchical folder values in NetX.  We use EMu's Security Department field (SecDepartment_tab) to determine a media-asset's NetX folder.

- `netxio.properties` example - an example of the proprties-file recommended for running [NetX I/O](https://support.netx.net/hc/en-us/articles/4409798060823) via the command line interface (CLI).
- `syncedMetadata` XML example - an example of an EMu/NetX mapping file required for [NetX DSS](https://support.netx.net/hc/en-us/articles/4409800580503-Data-Source-Sync).

## csv_good_examples
These include an example of a NetX pathAdd.csv, generated by `prep_pathadd.py`, to update a list of assets identified by their filenames (in the `file` column) by adding them to the folders in the `pathAdd` column.

## iiif
Examples of IIIF manifest JSON files generated by `mongo_to_IFFF.py`, to display a given media file and its corresponding EMu record data in a IIIF viewer such as [Universal Viewer](https://universalviewer.io)
- e.g., The manifest for FMNH EMu Multimedia irn "2450144" ([here](http://fm-digital-assets.fieldmuseum.org/2450/144/sue_3d_v4_color.glb)) can be previewed in the Universal Viewer ([here](https://uv-v4.netlify.app/#?manifest=https://fm-digital-assets.fieldmuseum.org/2609/561/2450144_sue_iiif_manifest.json&c=&m=&cv=&xywh=))

## xml_good_examples & xml_bad_examples
The "good" XML examples consist of the full folder structure for EMu XML exports on 2022-12-22.

### EMu Multimedia Exports:
Each XML files includes 10 corresponding multimedia records.

- "NetX_emultimedia" includes all mapped emultimedia fields, and is the main input for `prep_emu_media.py`.
  - The SecDepartment values in this XML file determine an asset's NetX folders.

- "NetX_mm_catalogue" includes 2 fields pulled from any reverse-attached ecatalogue records.

- "NetX_mm_events" includes 5 fields pulled from any reverse-attached event records.

- "NetX_mm_exhobj_mm" and "NetX_mm_exhobj_install" (not shown) include fields from reverse attached exhibit object records, as well as from the exhibit object's associated exhibit-event.

### EMu Groups Export
- "NetX_groups" adds (or updates) corresponding NetX Collections.

### EMu Audit Exports 
- "NetX_audit" exports allow dams-netx scripts to remove unpublished or deleted EMu Multimedia or Groups from NetX.


The "bad" XML examples include a variety of badly-formed individual files, as well as bad folder-structures and missing export-files.
